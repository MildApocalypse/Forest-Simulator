#Forest - Simulator
Group project by Lawrence Buck and Sam Costigan in COMP308 at Victoria Univeristy of Wellington. Updated
in 2024 to work with visual studio.

There is no executable or distribution for this project. I got it to work on my windows machine by setting 
up a C++ project in visual studio. 

Usage:
press O to toggle the between the use of the oct-tree and normal On-squared collision detection.
press S to show a visual representation of the oct-tree.
Left click and drag to rotate the view and scroll to zoom in and out.
